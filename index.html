    <h1>Hi there!</h1><br/>
        <p1>Here's a little game.</p1><br/>
        <p2>Game Rules</p2><br/>
        <p3>1.	Game Objective: Players need to control the paddle at the bottom of the screen to bounce the moving ball, using it to destroy bricks at the top of the screen. The player must eliminate all bricks to win the game.</p3><br/>
        <p4>2.Controls: Players use the left and right arrows on the keyboard or the mouse to move the paddle left and right. The paddle moves at a fixed speed, but players need to accurately predict and catch the bouncing ball.</p4><br/>
        <p5>3.	Ball Behavior: The ball bounces off the paddle and moves at a fixed angle. It rebounds when it hits bricks or the screen’s boundaries. When the ball touches the bottom edge of the screen, the player loses a life.</p5><br/>
        <p6>4.	Bricks: Bricks of different colors and (optionally) strengths are arranged at the top of the screen. Each time the ball hits a brick, the brick is destroyed or its strength is reduced. Some bricks may require multiple hits to be destroyed.</p6><br/>
        <p7>5.	Scoring and Lives: Players earn points for each brick destroyed. At the start of the game, the player has three lives. The player loses a life each time the ball hits the bottom. The game ends when all lives are lost.</p7><br/>
        <p8>6.	Special Bricks and Bonuses: Some bricks may contain bonuses, such as extra lives, extended paddles, or multi-balls. These bonuses drop when the brick is destroyed and must be caught with the paddle to activate.</p8><br/>
        <p9>7.	End of Game: The player wins if they destroy all the bricks. The game ends if the player loses all their lives.</p9><br/>
        <p10>8.	Difficulty Adjustments: The game’s difficulty can be increased by speeding up the ball, increasing brick strength, or decreasing the paddle size.</p10>
        
        <p11>Players should use strategy and reflexes to continually increase their score and challenge higher difficulty levels.</p11><br/>
